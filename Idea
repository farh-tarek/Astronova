The project is about a foundation that brings astronomy and science closer to children and youth in rural and underserved areas. This is achieved through mobile telescopes and educational workshops that allow young people to explore the sky and learn about the universe in an engaging way.

In addition, the foundation offers a digital platform and an AR application. By simply pointing their phone at the night sky, users can see the names of stars and planets in Arabic, along with fascinating stories from ancient Egyptian heritage.

The graphic design concept will focus on visually representing this mission—combining the wonder of the universe, the accessibility of modern technology, and the richness of cultural heritage—to inspire curiosity and make astronomy both fun and educational.
